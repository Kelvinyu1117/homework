\subsection*{Exercise 2}
Consider the following set:

$\forall{N} \in \mathbb{Z^+}, A_N = \{a_0z^n + a_1z^{n-1} + ... + a_n, z \in \mathbb{C}\mid n + |a_0| + |a_1| + ... + |a_n| = N\}$.

Given that $n + |a_0| + |a_1| + ... + |a_n| = N$ is finite, which means we can only have finite number of $a_i$, for each $\text{$i$ from 0 to $n$} $, 
therefore $A_N$ is also finite, 
and $\bigcup_{N \in \mathbb{N+}} A_N$ is finite due to the union of finite sets is finite, which means the set of all complex polynomials with integer coefficient is countable.

Let consider the roots of a particular polynomial in $A_N$, denoted as $B_N$:

$\forall{N} \in \mathbb{Z^+}, B_N = \{z \in \mathbb{C}\mid A_N(z) = 0\}$

Since the number of roots of a polynomial is finite and $A_N$ is finite, therefore $B_N$ is finite, and $\bigcup_{N \in \mathbb{N+}} B_N$ is finite too. Let the set $C = \bigcup_{N \in \mathbb{N+}} B_N$ contains all the algebraic numbers, C is countable.
