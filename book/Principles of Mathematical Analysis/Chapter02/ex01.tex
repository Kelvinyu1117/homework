\subsection*{Exercise 1}
We can prove it by contradiction: empty set is not a subset of every set.

Let $\phi$ to be a empty set, and $A$ to ba a arbitrary set. 
$\phi$ is not a subset of $A$ implies there is some element in $\phi$ that doesn't in $A$.

However, $\phi$ contains no element by the definition of empty set, which leads to contradiction.

Therefore, empty set is a subset of every set.
